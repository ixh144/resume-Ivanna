        I was born in Caracas, Venezuela in 1998 and moved to The United States when I was 11 years old. Before attending University of Miami I went to Northeastern University in Boston. In addition, I did a program called NUin where I did my first semester abroad in Rome, Italy. After one semester in Italy and one in Boston I decided to transfer to University of Miami. I am doing a double major in Management and Markting and even graduating a semester earlier than I was supposed to.
        I believe I am a strong and confident leader because of my experiences. In the future, the skills I have learned through leadership with help me accomplish my goal to be a successful business woman.
